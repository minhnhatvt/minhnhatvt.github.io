I am currently a research scientist in the field of Computer Vision & Graphics at AIOZ. My current work mainly focuses on multi-person human motion capture and motion synthesis. I received my B.Sc (Honour) in Computer Science from the University of Science, VNU-HCM. My undergraduate thesis focused on recognizing human emotion under real-world scenarios, resulting in two published papers (1 journal and 1 conference).
I am also actively seeking for a M.Sc./Ph.D. position in Machine Learning/Computer Vision.

My current research interests include:
* **Computer Vision**: 3D reconstruction, visual tracking system, human motion capture, human
behaviour analysis, human-scene synthesis and understanding.
* **Machine Learning**: Deep learning, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning, representation learning, generative modeling.

researcher with the [Data-driven Analysis of Peace Project](https://dapp-lab.org)
and a research collaborator with the 
[Research on International Policy Implementation Lab](https://bridgingthegapproject.org/ripil). -->

<!-- I received my Ph.D in Political Science from the
[University *of* North Carolina *at* Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu) and my
B.A. in Political Science from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu).
My academic work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in
*International Studies Quarterly*, *Conflict Management and Peace Science*,
*Political Science Research and Methods*, and *PS: Political Science & Politics*,
among other outlets. This [research](research) explores the causes and
consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as
latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While primarily
focused on civil conflict, it also examines contentious political phenomena
including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develops new measures of
institutions in international relations. I have [teaching](teaching) experience
in both quantitative methodology and international relations, and am a certified
instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org). -->
